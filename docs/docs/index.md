# Getting Started

## Introduction

Auth is hard. OAuth can be even harder—both to understand and to implement. The goal of the Okta Client JavaScript ecosystem is to enable developers to seamlessly integrate OAuth2 (and Okta APIs) into the applications they author, regardless of environment, and without requiring a comprehensive understanding of all the intricacies of the OAuth2 spec.

## Design Philosophy

At Okta, we strive for architectural parity across all of our client SDKs, regardless of language or environment. See the [Okta SDK Design](https://okta-client-design.netlify.app/design/) site for more details.

Okta Client JavaScript is developed with a developer-first approach. Our goal is to enable developers to seamlessly incorporate OAuth2 into new and (perhaps more importantly) existing applications without requiring major refactoring. We carefully consider how a developer would use any new class (pun fully intended), API, or paradigm before committing to the approach and merging it into the ecosystem.
