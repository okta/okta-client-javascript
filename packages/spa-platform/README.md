# @okta/spa-credential-manager

The OAuth/OIDC landscape is moving to a multi-token architecture. The `spa-credential-manager` (specifically the `Credential` class) is designed to be a logical abstraction between OAuth tokens and app developers. By providing a convenient API for storing, retrieving, and renewing tokens, this library aims to alleviate the burden of managing tokens. With `spa-credential-manager`, developers can focus on writing app code, not auth code.
